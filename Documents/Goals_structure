Goals: To analyze the ADAM grdient descent algorithm performance with different hyperparameters
Code Structure:
Adam_Gradient_convex_ICLR: Implements the ADAM algorithm. It is the main function.
Get_loss_function_value_convex: Loss function for the test. It is executed when user selects 'convex' for the main function input.
Get_loss_function_value_iclr: Loss function for the test. It is executed when user selects 'ICLR' for the main function input.
Plot_Store_Data: Display plots for the outcome and stores it in the Results folder.
